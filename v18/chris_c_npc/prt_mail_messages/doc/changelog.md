Implementation of star_multi method needs security improvementsImplementation of
star_multi method needs security improvements

The verification revealed several concerns with the current implementation:

    The star_multi() method simply iterates through records and calls toggle_message_starred() without any security checks
    The method is inherited from mail.message but doesn't call super() which might skip important base functionality
    There's no error handling for batch operations which could lead to partial failures

Suggested improvements:

    Add security checks using check_access_rights() and check_access_rule()
    Implement proper error handling for batch operations
    Consider calling super() to ensure base functionality is preserved
    Add transaction management for batch operations
